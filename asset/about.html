    <h3>What is GGrobee?</h3>
    <p>'GGrobee’ is a character born from the Khmer word ‘Kroap’, which means seed.</p>
    <p>Crop is a seed character created to prevent the natural environment from deteriorating and make Cambodia a clean country.</p>
    <p>In the process of growing, Crop goes through various obstacles and trials across four stages: waste, air pollution, water pollution, and sustainable development.</p>
    <p>If Crop solves the problems that hinder him as he grows, he will eventually grow into something wonderful and protect the Earth's environment.</p>
    <p>Would we all join in solving environmental problems so that Crop can grow into a wonderful person and achieve the goal of creating a clean planet?</p>
