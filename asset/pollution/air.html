              <h4 style="text-align: center;">Air</h4>
              <p style="text-align: center;">Air pollution is a term that refers to the presence of airborne pollutants in the atmosphere, which can deteriorate air quality in specific or extensive regions, negatively impacting human health, the environment, and the climate. These pollutants consist of gases and particles that make up the air, leading to issues such as the generation of ozone in the atmosphere, fine particulate matter, acid rain, the casting of shadows, and climate change.</p>
              <hr>
              <p style="text-align: center;">Causes of air pollution include automobile exhaust emissions, industrial and manufacturing activities, agricultural practices, fossil fuel consumption, and natural events like wildfires and volcanic eruptions, all contributing to environmental degradation, public health concerns, and ecosystem disruption. Therefore, air pollution management and monitoring are recognized as crucial environmental and public health issues, and various nations and international organizations are developing regulations and strategies to address them.</p>
              <hr>
              <p style="text-align: center;">In Cambodia, concerns about air pollution, particularly in urban areas such as Phnom Penh, have been growing. As of 2021, it's worth noting that the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions had increased significantly, with a 269% rise from 2000 levels, reaching 11,160 kilotons in 2018.</p>
              <hr>
              <h5 style="text-align: center;">various factors and problems, including:</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>Vehicle Emissions: The increasing number of vehicles and traffic on the roads is a major contributor to air pollution in Cambodia, as vehicle emissions release pollutants into the atmosphere.</li>
                <li>Industrial Pollution: Industrial facilities, particularly in industries such as textiles and petrochemicals, release pollution into the air, making industrial activities a significant source of air pollution.</li>
                <li>Waste Management: Inadequate waste disposal and incineration practices contribute to air pollution from waste-related activities.</li>
                <li>Particulate Matter (PM2.5): High concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air are a significant concern in Cambodia, associated with health issues.</li>
                <li>Monitoring Gaps: While air quality monitoring has improved, there are still gaps in the monitoring network, making it challenging to provide comprehensive real-time data on air quality.</li>
              </ol>
              <hr>
              <p style="text-align: center;">Efforts are underway to address air pollution issues in Cambodia, with a focus on reducing emissions, promoting cleaner technologies, and improving air quality monitoring. Cambodia still increasing awareness of air pollution issues and enhancing efforts for air pollution management, with support from international organizations and the implementation of domestic policies.</p>
