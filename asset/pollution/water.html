              <h4 style="text-align: center;">Water</h4>
              <h style="text-align: center;">Water pollution refers to the environmental issue where water becomes contaminated or altered in quality due to changes in the presence of substances or conditions within it. This leads to a deterioration of water quality and can have adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. Water pollution can take various forms depending on the quantity and types of contaminants present in the water. It can impact plants, animals, humans, and aquatic ecosystems, making water pollution a significant environmental concern.</h>

              <h style="text-align: center;">Water pollution issues in Cambodia refer to the presence of harmful substances, contaminants, and pollutants in water bodies within the country. This pollution can include a variety of materials and pollutants, leading to a degradation of water quality. Water pollution can have adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems, drinking water quality, and overall environmental health.<h>
              <hr>
              <h style="text-align: center;">In Cambodia, these water pollution problems manifest as a result of factors such as inadequate wastewater treatment, the excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture, discharges from industrial activities, improper waste management, groundwater contamination, and population growth. Water pollution can impact aquatic life, compromise the safety of drinking water sources, and undermine the health and well-being of the population. It is a pressing environmental concern that requires effective management and mitigation strategies to safeguard water quality and aquatic ecosystems.</h>
              <hr>
              <h5 style="text-align: center;">Issues to consider:</h5>
              <ul>
              <li>Water contamination: Water contamination and accessibility are significant concerns in Cambodia. Groundwater has been found to contain substances of health concern, including arsenic, fluoride, nitrates, and manganese. Access to safe drinking water is challenging, especially outside urban areas, and there is a lack of infrastructure for efficient water resource management.</li>
              <li>Industrial and agricultural pollution: Untreated industrial effluents and agricultural runoff containing pesticides and fertilizers have been major contributors to water pollution in Cambodia. Many industrial facilities lacked proper wastewater treatment systems.</li>
              <li>Sanitation and wastewater issues: In urban areas, inadequate sanitation infrastructure and wastewater treatment facilities have led to the discharge of untreated sewage into rivers and water bodies. In some cases, open defecation practices in rural areas have also impacted water quality.</li>
              <li>Use of harmful chemicals: Small-scale gold mining operations along rivers and tributaries, involving the use of hazardous chemicals like mercury and cyanide, pose serious environmental and health risks.</li>
              <li>Hydropower development: Rapid hydropower development in Cambodia has contributed to energy production but raised concerns about potential impacts on water quality, aquatic ecosystems, and sediment and flow regime alterations.</li>
              <li>Urbanization and waste disposal: The rapid urbanization of cities like Phnom Penh has led to increased waste generation. Improper solid waste management, including the improper disposal of plastic waste, has often resulted in litter and water pollution.</li>
              <li>Impact on health and ecosystems: Water pollution has had adverse effects on both human health and aquatic ecosystems. Contaminated water sources have posed health risks, and polluted rivers and lakes have affected fish populations and biodiversity.</li>
              </ul>
              <hr>
              <h6 style="text-align: center;">As a result of these factors, Cambodia faces water pollution problems that deteriorate water quality, impacting human health and ecosystems. Efforts by the government and international organizations are focused on improving wastewater treatment and resource management for sustainable water quality.</h6>
