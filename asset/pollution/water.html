              <h6>It is the forest with many trees that cleans the polluted air. But these forests are shrinking every year. So saving paper and planting a lot of trees is the best way to clean the air. Planting trees in the mountains can prevent floods and control drought. It is also necessary to plant new trees, but it is also important to take good care of the trees that have already been planted and grow them healthy.</h6>
