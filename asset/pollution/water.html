              <h4>Water</h4>
              <h6>What happens when the water is contaminated: Water discharged from households becomes dirty with detergents and food waste. Water released from rice paddies contains fertilizers and pesticides, while water from factories may contain heavy metals. When these substances flow directly into rivers and seas, aquatic life, including fish and birds, can become ill or die. Consuming contaminated fish and birds can lead to diseases such as nerve paralysis and deformities.</h6>
              <h6>We don't have enough water: Despite about 70% of the Earth's surface being covered in water, most of it is saltwater, which cannot be consumed or used for farming. Freshwater, suitable for drinking and everyday use, constitutes only about 0.3% of the world's water, primarily sourced from rivers and lakes. While the world has enough water for everyone, it is not evenly distributed. Approximately 60% of the global population lives in Asia, which has access to only about 36% of the world's rivers and lakes. As the population grows, the demand for water has increased significantly. In fact, water consumption has multiplied by six times in the past century. With a growing population in the future, water scarcity is expected to be even more pronounced. This calls for preparation.</h6>
              <h6>The ocean turns red:When the concentration of phytoplankton, plant-like organisms in the ocean, increases, the sea can appear red, a phenomenon known as a "red tide." This occurrence is linked to a sudden surge in nutrients, often from water pollution, that serves as food for phytoplankton. As a result, phytoplankton populations explode, causing a red tide. This can harm fish populations, as many phytoplankton species are toxic, and oxygen depletion due to their excessive growth can lead to fish mortality.</h6>
              <h6>Issues to consider:</h6>
              <h6>1. Water contamination: Water contamination and accessibility are significant concerns in Cambodia. Groundwater has been found to contain substances of health concern, including arsenic, fluoride, nitrates, and manganese. Access to safe drinking water is challenging, especially outside urban areas, and there is a lack of infrastructure for efficient water resource management.</h6>
              <h6>2. Industrial and agricultural pollution: Untreated industrial effluents and agricultural runoff containing pesticides and fertilizers have been major contributors to water pollution in Cambodia. Many industrial facilities lacked proper wastewater treatment systems.</h6>
              <h6>3. Sanitation and wastewater issues: In urban areas, inadequate sanitation infrastructure and wastewater treatment facilities have led to the discharge of untreated sewage into rivers and water bodies. In some cases, open defecation practices in rural areas have also impacted water quality.</h6>
              <h6>4. Use of harmful chemicals: Small-scale gold mining operations along rivers and tributaries, involving the use of hazardous chemicals like mercury and cyanide, pose serious environmental and health risks.</h6>
              <h6>5. Hydropower development: Rapid hydropower development in Cambodia has contributed to energy production but raised concerns about potential impacts on water quality, aquatic ecosystems, and sediment and flow regime alterations.</h6>
              <h6>6. Urbanization and waste disposal: The rapid urbanization of cities like Phnom Penh has led to increased waste generation. Improper solid waste management, including the improper disposal of plastic waste, has often resulted in litter and water pollution.</h6>
              <h6>7. Impact on health and ecosystems: Water pollution has had adverse effects on both human health and aquatic ecosystems. Contaminated water sources have posed health risks, and polluted rivers and lakes have affected fish populations and biodiversity.</h6>
