              <h4>Waste</h4>
              <h6>A lot of garbage: Garbage can be broadly categorized into "household waste" and "industrial waste." Household waste includes items discarded from daily life, such as food and plastics. Industrial waste refers to waste generated by factories and construction sites. Most non-recyclable waste is often incinerated in waste incineration plants. However, the smoke produced during incineration can pollute the air, particularly emitting a chemical called "dioxin," which has harmful effects on living organisms. Landfills, where garbage is buried, can generate a strong odor due to methane gas and dirty water from decomposing waste, and the substances produced during decomposition can contaminate the soil and rivers.</h6>
              <h6>Sell garbage:Factories generate a significant amount of industrial waste, including residues from burnt fuels, dirty water, soil, and used oil. Such industrial waste is commonly referred to as "industrial waste." Since industrial waste often contains harmful substances, it should not be incinerated or landfilled without caution. To prevent the disposal of industrial waste worldwide, laws have been put in place, leading to the emergence of industrial waste disposal companies. In some cases, these companies have sold their waste to other countries. However, in those countries, the rapid environmental degradation caused by such practices has been astonishing. Hence, the Basel Convention was established to address this issue, preventing the movement of hazardous industrial waste to other countries.</h6>
              <h6>Issues to consider:</h6>
              <h6>Inadequate waste collection and disposal infrastructure: Cambodia, especially in rural areas, faces challenges due to the lack of comprehensive waste collection and disposal infrastructure. Many local communities lack regular waste collection services, leading to improper waste disposal practices like open dumping and burning.</h6>
              <h6>Increasing urbanization and waste generation: Rapid urbanization, particularly in cities like Phnom Penh, has led to a surge in waste generation. As more people migrate to urban areas, the quantity of solid waste in cities has significantly increased.</h6>
              <h6>Plastic pollution: Plastic pollution has been a notable issue in Cambodia, with single-use plastics such as bags and packaging materials being widely used. These plastics often litter streets, rivers, and natural environments, causing visual pollution and posing threats to wildlife and aquatic ecosystems.</h6>
              <h6>Health and environmental concerns: Improper waste management practices, such as outdoor burning and inadequate disposal, have posed health risks to local communities. Incinerating waste releases harmful pollutants into the air, and improper disposal can lead to soil and water contamination, impacting public health and the environment.</h6>
              <h6>Lack of recycling and waste separation: Cambodia has limited recycling and waste separation programs. Most waste is either landfilled or openly burned, with a small fraction being recycled or composted.</h6>
