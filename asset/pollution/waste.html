                <h4 style="text-align: center;">Waste</h4>
              <h style="text-align: center;">The waste problem is a global issue characterized by the continuous generation of waste, improper disposal leading to environmental degradation and health problems, wasteful use of valuable resources, and the exacerbation of social inequalities. To address this problem, effective waste management and recycling systems need to be established, public awareness should be raised, and sustainable consumption and production practices promoted.</h>

              <h style="text-align: center;">Water pollution in Cambodia refers to the contamination of water bodies in the country due to the presence of harmful substances, pollutants, and contaminants. This pollution results in deteriorating water quality, posing risks to aquatic ecosystems and public health. The issues are caused by factors such as inadequate wastewater treatment, excessive pesticide and fertilizer use in agriculture, industrial discharges, poor waste management, groundwater contamination, and population growth. Water pollution can have detrimental effects on aquatic life, the safety of drinking water sources, and overall environmental well-being, requiring effective management and mitigation efforts.</h>
              <hr>
              <h5 style="text-align: center;">Several factors contribute to this issue:</h5>
              <ul>
              <li>Inadequate waste collection and disposal infrastructure: Cambodia, especially in rural areas, faces challenges due to the lack of comprehensive waste collection and disposal infrastructure. Many local communities lack regular waste collection services, leading to improper waste disposal practices like open dumping and burning.</li>
              <li>Increasing urbanization and waste generation: Rapid urbanization, particularly in cities like Phnom Penh, has led to a surge in waste generation. As more people migrate to urban areas, the quantity of solid waste in cities has significantly increased.</li>
              <li>Plastic pollution: Plastic pollution has been a notable issue in Cambodia, with single-use plastics such as bags and packaging materials being widely used. These plastics often litter streets, rivers, and natural environments, causing visual pollution and posing threats to wildlife and aquatic ecosystems.</li>
              <li>Health and environmental concerns: Improper waste management practices, such as outdoor burning and inadequate disposal, have posed health risks to local communities. Incinerating waste releases harmful pollutants into the air, and improper disposal can lead to soil and water contamination, impacting public health and the environment.</li>
              <li>Lack of recycling and waste separation: Cambodia has limited recycling and waste separation programs. Most waste is either landfilled or openly burned, with a small fraction being recycled or composted.</li>
              </ul>
              <hr>
              <h style="text-align: center;">Efforts are being made to address Cambodia's waste problem, including initiatives to improve waste collection and management infrastructure, promote recycling, and raise public awareness. NGOs and international organizations are also working with the Cambodian government to implement sustainable waste management practices. However, it remains a significant challenge that requires continued investment, education, and policy enforcement to mitigate its adverse effects on the environment and public health.</h>
