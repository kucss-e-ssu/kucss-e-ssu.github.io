        <h4>Air</h4>
        <h6>If the water is dirty with oily food, about 200,000 times more clear water is needed. Therefore, wiping oil or food waste from a bowl with tissue and washing dishes is the wisdom to prevent water pollution. It's also important to save water in your daily life. If you collect one or two drops of water in a year, it's 4,000 liters.</h6>

        <h4>Water</h4>
        <h6>It is the forest with many trees that cleans the polluted air. But these forests are shrinking every year. So saving paper and planting a lot of trees is the best way to clean the air. Planting trees in the mountains can prevent floods and control drought. It is also necessary to plant new trees, but it is also important to take good care of the trees that have already been planted and grow them healthy.</h6>

        <h4>SDGs</h4>
        <h6>Sustainable development means development that can develop the lives of our generation while considering the environment of future generations. Developments
          so far have considered economic growth more important than the environment of the future. But now, when we do economic development, we are trying to develop only what the ecosystem can accept, so that people can live clean lives.</h6>
