    <h3>Sustainable Development Goals about environment - 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17</h3>

        <p>"Global Goals," also known as the "Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)," are a set of 17 interconnected goals established by the United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. SDGs are designed to address a wide range of global challenges and guide international efforts towards a fairer, more prosperous, and sustainable future. They provide a universal framework for governments, organizations, and individuals to collaborate in achieving a better world by 2030.</p>

        <p>The ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) elements included in SDGs consist of six key components, namely SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). Businesses and organizations that align with these goals contribute to broader environmental sustainability efforts.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Sustainable development aims to promote clean energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect biodiversity, and promote sustainable agricultural and forestry practices, with the goal of achieving a carbon-neutral ASEAN by 2050.</p>

          <li>Water Quality : The objectives of water pollution regulation are to prevent public waterbody pollution, protect human health, and preserve biodiversity in rivers, lakes, and coastal areas. Public water quality standards are provided to preserve biodiversity in public water bodies. Climate change adaptation includes supporting dam, irrigation facility, and river management infrastructure capable of responding to floods and droughts. Additionally, urban areas expand water supply infrastructure to ensure a stable water supply.</li>
          <li>Air Quality : There is a lack of a well-established system for regularly measuring air quality, and monitoring stations are not adequately installed. Officially published data on air quality observation in Cambodia is limited, with data primarily focused on Phnom Penh. Monitoring of air pollution in Phnom Penh started around 2000, and measurements are taken as needed.</li>
          <li>Waste Management : The rapid urbanization and population growth in major cities have led to a continuous increase in waste generation. Cambodia lacks comprehensive waste collection and disposal infrastructure. In rural areas, the absence of regular waste collection services has led to improper waste disposal practices, such as open dumping and burning, which negatively impact the environment and public health. Public awareness regarding waste recycling, disposal, and separation is relatively low.</li>
